# GitHub Collaboration Analysis Project
**Overview**
This project aims to analyze interactions among GitHub users and repositories to gain insights into user behavior and collaboration patterns within the GitHub community. By leveraging Python libraries such as NetworkX and Matplotlib, we explore various aspects of collaboration, including identifying popular users and repositories, examining centrality measures, and investigating the concept of polyglot programmersâ€”users proficient in multiple programming languages.
